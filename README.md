# PyEditor (Python Text Editor)

PyEditor is a Python text editor that is written in Python and supports file management, as well as common windows shortcut commands (CTRL+S for saving, CTRL+O for opening a file, CTRL+R to run) as well as basic syntax highlighting.

IMPORTANT: if you run the main script in a Python version that is older than 3.10, you will get a syntax error due to a match case in text_editor.py

# Bugs

There is currently a problem with highlighting and its interaction with the undo and redo commands currently implemented.
